# React Forms

## Introduction

This repository holds examples of forms created for use with React. The repo was begun in April, 2022 in conjunction with development of my [Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Character Creator App](https://github.com/scottalandev/smashbroscreator-reactts). That project is built around a large and complex form and I needed a simpler, cleaner workspace to try/troubleshoot form techniques, particularly how to manage onChange event handlers with a complex state object containing nested objects.

## Purpose

This project exists primarily for my own practice, experimentation, and reference. I expect I will return periodically to this repo to trial/demo new/different form techniques/applications in future React development. I am not actively publishing links to this repo, but if it helps someone else, that is wonderful!

## Project Info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Run

Clone this git repository, run `npm install` to install dependencies, and `npm start` to open the default Create React App local development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

There are other scripts available by default courtesy of Create React App. Check out the **package.json** file and the CRA docs for more info.
